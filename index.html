            Quotes
            <br>
            Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch.
            You affect the world by what you browse.
            The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.
